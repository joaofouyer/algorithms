## Day 0: Hello, World! :earth_americas:

[Hello, World](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-hello-world/problem) is a very simple example in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. So it's the best pick for the day zero.

Let's get somethings more spicy and read the input and then print after the Hello, World.

````
Hello, World.

42 rules the universe!

````

## Day 1: Very Simple Data Types :pager:

[This task](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/problem) offers a brief introduction to simple data types.

Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1. Declare _3_ variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read _3_ lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
3. Use the _+_ operator to perform the following operations:
i. Print the sum of _i_ plus your int variable on a new line.
ii. Print the sum of _d_ plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
iii. Concatenate _s_ with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

>Note: If you are using a language that doesn't support using  for string concatenation (e.g.: C), you can just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor must be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.

**Sample Input**

```
12
4.0
is the answer of the life, universe and everything else!
```

**Sample Output**
```
16
8.0
42 is the answer of the life, universe and everything else!
```

## Day 2: Operators :notebook:
[In this](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators/problem) challenge, you'll work with arithmetic operators.

Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

**Sample Input**
```
12.00
20
8
```

**Sample Output**
```
15
```

## Day 3: Conditional Statements :door:
[In this](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements/problem) challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements.

Given an integer, _n_, perform the following conditional actions:

If _n_ is odd, print Weird
If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print ´Not Weird´
If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print ´Weird´
If _n_ is even and greater than 20, print ´Not Weird´


**Sample Input**
```
3
```

**Sample Output**
```
Weird
```

**Sample Input**
```
42
```

**Sample Output**
```
Not Weird
```
