Some algorithms and problem sets for practising and enhancing development skills.

This repository is a personal implementation of a collection of algorithms and data structure. It provides solutions for puzzles in various languages spanning C, C++, Python, Javascript and others.

The foremost goal is to expand some logical thinking and development skills in distinct computer programming languages.

The puzzles are from problems sets as seen in college, algorithms books, some coding websites and interview questions.

> **The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music.** - _Donald Knuth_

# Algorithms Structure

Currently the content it's sort of messy but I'm trying to keep it organized by the type of the problem.

- [30 days of Code :calendar:](https://github.com/joaofouyer/algorithms/tree/master/30-days-of-code): very simple algorithms to get in touch with any programming language. 

- [Problem Solving :bulb:](https://github.com/joaofouyer/algorithms/tree/master/problem-solving): from simple to complex problems where the logical thinking behind them is more important than the programming language itself.

- [10 days of Statistics](https://github.com/joaofouyer/algorithms/tree/master/statistics) :bar_chart:: a small set of simple statistics problems.
